# Message-Server-GUI
This is a ROBLOX open source project where you can send a message to all players in a server.


This is similar to another one which BA Essentials had. I was dissapointed that there was not a GUI version of it and only a command version of it. 

I plan in the future if I get enough future to do a version when you can choose if you want to display a message as a hint or as a main server message. At the moment, I am just planning on having it as a main server message. 

It's really fun to provide to you people this thing for FREE and hope that you enjoy it. 

Make sure to create a pull request if you have any suggestions on new features. As well as that report any bugs in the Issues part and I'll try to take a look at them as good as I can.

Hope you once again enjoy this.

Here is also the free model you can get: https://www.roblox.com/library/6750359218/Message-Gui-Model

Instructions where to ungroup them is told on the model. To ungroup, drag it into the service and then either do CTRL + U/CMD + U or right click the model and then click "Ungroup".
